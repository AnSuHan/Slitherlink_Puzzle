However, the left line is not the correct answer because the box on the left has a '0', meaning all lines of that box cannot be colored. Therefore, since the colored box has a '3' on it, click on the remaining lines to ensure all 3 lines are colored!",
  "howToPlay_Step1": "Step 2: Now, take a look at the colored boxes. Each box has one inactive line and already colored lines. The box marked '3' must have a total of 3 colored lines, so color in the remaining two lines to match the number!",
  "howToPlay_Step2": "Step 3: Next, you need to check the direction that the colored boxes should connect to. Since you need to continue the left line, please click on the upper line!",
  "howToPlay_Step3": "Step 4: Now, you need to follow the lines you've already clicked. Each box has two lines remaining, so click on the remaining lines to complete the connection.",
